# Globalinc
A visualisation of the Global Income Distribution since 1980.

Here I use data from the Global Consumption Income Project (http://gcip.info/) to build a visualisation demonstrating
the changing shape of global income since 1980. 

Access the files [here](html/fig_050816_1980.html)

<div class="container content">
  
  {{ content }}
  {% include_relative html/fig_050816_1980.html %}

</div>

{% include_relative html/fig_050816_1980.html
max-width="1000px" %} 



The .html files are rough output and not designed for final presentation, but as a way to navigate through the years. To view, open the 'html' folder and click on any file. They should open in the browser and allow navigation between years.

This constitutes part of my work on the open-access curriculum reform in Economics, for more information see http://www.core-econ.org/.
