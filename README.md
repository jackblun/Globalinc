Visualisation of the Global Income Distribution

Here I use data from the Global Consumption Income Project (http://gcip.info/) to build a visualisation demonstrating
the changing shape of global income since 1980. 

The .html files are rough output and not designed for final presentation, but as a way to navigate through the years.
